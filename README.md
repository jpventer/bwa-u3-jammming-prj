I had to use the Deeezer API as Spotify was not available in my country.

I could not get the sequencing of my calls to save the playlist correct (utils>Deezer.js), I don't get the the whole .then() chaining process so please advice on that part, thanks!

Update: I have it working now! Finally got the whole .then() sequencing. You will need a deezer account to run it. My surge site is up here:
